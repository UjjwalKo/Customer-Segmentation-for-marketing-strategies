<h2>Customer Segmentation for Marketing Strategies</h2>
This project focuses on customer segmentation using machine learning techniques to develop targeted marketing strategies. By analyzing customer data, the project aims to group customers based on their purchasing behavior, which can help businesses tailor their marketing efforts to different customer segments.

Project Overview
Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of marketing strategy, allowing businesses to identify distinct groups within their customer base and tailor their efforts accordingly. In this project, we use clustering algorithms like K-Means and DBSCAN to segment customers based on their transactional data.

Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project is an online retail dataset containing transactional data. Each row represents an individual transaction, with the following features:

InvoiceNo: Unique transaction identifier.
StockCode: Unique product identifier.
Description: Product name or type.
Quantity: Number of units purchased.
InvoiceDate: Date and time of the transaction.
UnitPrice: Price per unit of the product.
CustomerID: Unique customer identifier.
Country: Customer's country.

Requirements
To run the project, you need the following Python libraries:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

Usage
Load the Dataset: The data should be placed in the data directory. Load it using the provided scripts in the Jupyter Notebook or Python files.

Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes cleaning and preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, feature extraction, and scaling.

Model Training: Two clustering algorithms, K-Means and DBSCAN, are applied to segment the customers. The optimal number of clusters for K-Means is determined using the Elbow Method.

Visualization: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data for visualization purposes, allowing for a 2D plot of customer segments.

Results
The project identifies distinct customer segments based on purchasing behavior. These segments can be visualized and analyzed to understand different customer groups' characteristics, such as high-value customers, frequent buyers, or discount-driven shoppers.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used for customer segmentation to enhance marketing strategies. By clustering customers based on their behavior, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts to specific groups, improving customer satisfaction and business outcomes.
